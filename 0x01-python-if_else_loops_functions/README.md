In this project, I started working with conditionals and loops in Python. I applied concepts related to if, if ... else, break, continue, pass, and the range statement in combination with while and for loops. Additionally, I practiced creating my own Python functions while learning about variable scope, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
Here are the tasks and their explanations for this project:

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

0-positive_or_negative.py: A Python program that assigns
a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and
prints whether number is positive or negative.
Prints the number followed by:
If the number is greater than 0: is positive
If the number is 0: is zero
If the number is less than 0: is negative
Followed by a new line.
Based on this source code.
1. The last digit

1-last_digit.py: A Python program that assigns a random signed number
to the variable number each time it is executed and prints its last digit.
Prints the string Last digit of [number] is [last_digit] followed by:
If the number is greater than 5: and is greater than 5
If the number is 0: and is 0
If the number is less than 6 and not 0: and is less than 6 and not 0
Followed by a new line.
Based on this source code.
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

2-print_alphabet.py: A Python program that prints the alphabet
in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
Uses only one print statement and one loop.
Does not store characters in variables or import modules.
3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

3-print_alphabt.py: A Python program that prints the
alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Uses only one print statement and one loop.
Does not store characters in variables or import modules.
Prints every letter except for q and e.
4. Hexadecimal printing

4-print_hexa.py: A Python program that prints all numbers from
0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
Uses only one print statement and one loop.
Does not store numbers or strings in variables or import modules.
Prints in the format: [decimal] = [hexadecimal]
5. 00...99

5-print_comb2.py: A Python program that prints numbers from 0
to 99 in two digits each.
Numbers are separated by , , except for the last number, which is followed by a new line.
Uses no more than two print functions and one loop.
Does not store numbers or strings in variables or import modules.
6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

6-print_comb3.py: A Python program that prints all possible
different combinations of two digits in ascending order.
Numbers are separated by , , except for the last number, which is followed by a new line.
The two digits must be different - 01 and 10 are considered identical.
Uses no more than three print functions and two loops.
Does not store numbers or strings in variables or import modules.
7. islower

7-islower.py: A Python function that checks for lowercase characters.
Returns True if c is lowercase, False otherwise.
Does not import modules or use str.upper() or str.isupper().
8. To uppercase

8-uppercase.py: A Python function that prints a string in
uppercase followed by a new line.
Uses no more than two print functions and one loop.
Does not import modules or use str.upper() or str.isupper().
9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

9-print_last_digit.py: A Python function that prints the last
digit of a number.
Returns the value of the last digit.
Does not import modules.
10. a + b

[10-add
